# ai-powered-cs-learning-portal
My final year undergraduate Computer Science project.

The overall aim of this project is to develop a web platform to improve access to high-quality, free Computer Science materials for KS3/4 students and teachers.
The platform will incorporate Artificial Intelligence to guide users to relevant Computer Science educational resources regardless of their subject expertise.
